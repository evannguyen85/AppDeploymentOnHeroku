Common issues:
1) when pushing to heroku:
fatal: 'heroku' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.

Resolution:
1) First, make sure you're logged into heroku:
  heroku login 
  
Enter your credentials.

2) Second, It's common to get this error when using a cloned git repo onto a new machine. 
Even if your heroku credentials are already on the machine, there is no link between the cloned repo and heroku locally yet. 
To do this, cd into the root dir of the cloned repo and run
  heroku git:remote -a yourapp
  (yourapp: is the name of the app created by heroku create, eg: boiling-brook-33207)
